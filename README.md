This simple program will switch to the given i3 workspace.

If you have (exactly) two active outputs, the activated workspace will be moved to the focused output and the workspace that occupied that output will be moved to the second output.

In any other setup (one, three or more outputs) it will behave exactly the same as the default i3 behavior.
